# WaterTrace Pakistan

## Overview
WaterTrace is an advanced machine learning system for groundwater prediction and monitoring, designed to address Pakistan's critical water crisis through AI-driven insights. By leveraging 22 years of satellite data from NASA's GRACE mission (2002-2017) and GLDAS land surface models (2018-2024), this geospatial AI platform provides predictive analytics for groundwater depletion patterns across 145 districts, enabling data-driven water resource management through time-series forecasting and regression modeling.

## Key Features
- **Geospatial AI Integration**: Advanced ML models combining GRACE gravity anomaly data and GLDAS soil moisture measurements
- **District-Level ML Predictions**: AI-powered analysis across all 145 districts of Pakistan
- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Real-time charts showing 22-year groundwater trends with ML insights
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Machine learning models (R² = 0.89) for future trend prediction and anomaly detection
- **Responsive ML Dashboard**: Fully mobile-optimized interface for real-time predictive analytics
- **RESTful ML API**: Comprehensive endpoints for model predictions and data integration

## Technical Stack
The ML platform combines React 18 with Recharts for dynamic predictive analytics visualization, Flask for a robust ML API backend, and Pandas/NumPy for efficient feature engineering and data processing. Google Earth Engine powers geospatial data access, while Scikit-learn enables regression modeling, time-series forecasting, and model validation. Interactive maps with ML overlays are rendered using Leaflet, with Tailwind CSS ensuring responsive design across all devices.

## Satellite Data Integration
The system processes multiple data sources:
- **GRACE Satellites (2002-2017)**: Direct groundwater measurements via gravity anomalies
- **GLDAS V021 (2018-2024)**: Deep soil moisture (100-200cm) as groundwater proxy
- **Temporal Resolution**: Monthly aggregated data points
- **Spatial Coverage**: Complete Pakistan territory with district-level aggregation
- **Data Volume**: 163 GRACE observations + 72 GLDAS measurements

## Impact Metrics
Analysis reveals Pakistan's severe water crisis:
- **13.71 cm** total groundwater loss over 15 years (2002-2017)
- **0.81 cm/year** consistent depletion rate with p-value < 0.001
- **Critical Regions**: Quetta (-15.3 cm), Lahore (-12.5 cm), Punjab agricultural belt
- **Recent Stabilization**: GLDAS indicates possible improvement (+1.5 kg/m²/year)
- **15+ districts** facing critical water stress requiring immediate intervention

## Data Visualization
- **Time Series Analysis**: Complete 22-year timeline with data source indicators
- **Interactive District Map**: Color-coded groundwater stress levels
- **Trend Analysis**: Linear regression and seasonal decomposition
- **Statistical Dashboards**: Real-time metrics and KPIs
- **Export Capabilities**: Data download for further analysis

## Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Feature Engineering**: Seasonal decomposition, temporal trends, lag features, climate variables, and geospatial indicators
- **Model Comparison**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting for ensemble predictions
- **Validation Strategy**: Time series cross-validation with 80/20 split to prevent data leakage
- **Performance Metrics**: RMSE = 0.67 cm, MAE = 0.52 cm, R² = 0.89 for robust predictions
- **Prediction Horizon**: 6-month forward time-series forecasting with confidence intervals
- **Model Interpretability**: SHAP values for feature importance and prediction explainability

## What I Learned
This project was a significant learning experience that taught me invaluable lessons about real-world ML applications:

### Technical Skills
- **Data Pipeline Engineering**: Learned to process and merge 22 years of satellite data from two different sources (GRACE and GLDAS) with varying temporal resolutions and formats
- **Google Earth Engine**: Mastered the Google Earth Engine API for large-scale geospatial data processing, learning to handle multi-terabyte satellite datasets efficiently
- **Time-Series ML**: Gained deep understanding of time-series forecasting challenges including seasonality, trends, and preventing data leakage in temporal cross-validation
- **Full-Stack ML Development**: Built an end-to-end ML application integrating React frontend, Flask ML API, and interactive data visualizations

### Problem-Solving Challenges
- **Data Quality Issues**: Overcame the challenge of merging GRACE data (2002-2017) with GLDAS proxy data (2018-2024) while maintaining prediction accuracy
- **Spatial Aggregation**: Learned to aggregate pixel-level satellite data to district boundaries, handling irregular administrative geometries
- **Model Optimization**: Improved model performance from initial R² of 0.65 to 0.89 through systematic feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning
- **Scalability**: Optimized data processing pipeline to handle 145 districts × 235 monthly observations efficiently

### Impact & Real-World Application
- **Domain Knowledge**: Deepened understanding of Pakistan's water crisis and how ML can contribute to environmental policy
