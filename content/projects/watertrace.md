# WaterTrace Pakistan

## Overview
WaterTrace is a cutting-edge groundwater monitoring and analysis system designed to address Pakistan's critical water crisis. By leveraging 22 years of satellite data from NASA's GRACE mission (2002-2017) and GLDAS land surface models (2018-2024), this platform provides real-time insights into groundwater depletion patterns across 145 districts, enabling data-driven water resource management decisions.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Temporal Satellite Analysis**: Integration of GRACE gravity anomaly data and GLDAS soil moisture measurements
- **District-Level Monitoring**: Granular analysis across all 145 districts of Pakistan
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time charts showing 22-year groundwater trends
- **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning models (R² = 0.89) for future trend forecasting
- **Responsive Dashboard**: Fully mobile-optimized interface for accessibility
- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive data access endpoints for integration

## Technical Stack
The platform combines React 18 with Recharts for dynamic data visualization, Flask for a robust RESTful API backend, and Pandas/NumPy for efficient data processing. Google Earth Engine powers satellite data access, while Scikit-learn enables predictive modeling. Interactive maps are rendered using Leaflet, with Tailwind CSS ensuring responsive design across all devices.

## Satellite Data Integration
The system processes multiple data sources:
- **GRACE Satellites (2002-2017)**: Direct groundwater measurements via gravity anomalies
- **GLDAS V021 (2018-2024)**: Deep soil moisture (100-200cm) as groundwater proxy
- **Temporal Resolution**: Monthly aggregated data points
- **Spatial Coverage**: Complete Pakistan territory with district-level aggregation
- **Data Volume**: 163 GRACE observations + 72 GLDAS measurements

## Impact Metrics
Analysis reveals Pakistan's severe water crisis:
- **13.71 cm** total groundwater loss over 15 years (2002-2017)
- **0.81 cm/year** consistent depletion rate with p-value < 0.001
- **Critical Regions**: Quetta (-15.3 cm), Lahore (-12.5 cm), Punjab agricultural belt
- **Recent Stabilization**: GLDAS indicates possible improvement (+1.5 kg/m²/year)
- **15+ districts** facing critical water stress requiring immediate intervention

## Data Visualization
- **Time Series Analysis**: Complete 22-year timeline with data source indicators
- **Interactive District Map**: Color-coded groundwater stress levels
- **Trend Analysis**: Linear regression and seasonal decomposition
- **Statistical Dashboards**: Real-time metrics and KPIs
- **Export Capabilities**: Data download for further analysis

## Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Feature Engineering**: Seasonal indicators, temporal trends, climate variables
- **Model Comparison**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Validation Strategy**: Time series split with 80/20 ratio
- **Performance Metrics**: RMSE = 0.67 cm, MAE = 0.52 cm
- **Prediction Horizon**: 6-month forward forecasting capability

## Future Roadmap
- Integration with GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission data
- Real-time precipitation and climate data correlation
- District-wise water stress alert system
- Mobile application for field monitoring
- Policy recommendation engine for water managers
- Integration with Pakistan's water management systems
