# GeoInsight Platform

## Overview
GeoInsight Platform is a comprehensive environmental monitoring system that revolutionizes how we track and analyze environmental changes. By integrating satellite imagery, IoT sensors, and weather data, the platform provides real-time insights into deforestation, air quality, and climate patterns.

## Key Features
- **Satellite Image Analysis**: Automated processing of satellite imagery for change detection
- **IoT Sensor Integration**: Real-time data collection from environmental sensors
- **Air Quality Monitoring**: Comprehensive tracking of air pollutants and quality indices
- **Deforestation Detection**: Advanced algorithms to identify and track forest changes
- **Climate Pattern Analysis**: Long-term trend analysis and climate modeling

## Technical Architecture
Built with Vue.js for a responsive frontend experience and FastAPI for high-performance backend services. The platform uses PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions for spatial data management, GDAL for geospatial data processing, and TensorFlow for machine learning models.

## Environmental Impact
The platform has been instrumental in:
- Early detection of illegal deforestation activities
- Monitoring air quality in urban areas
- Tracking climate change indicators
- Supporting conservation efforts with data-driven insights
- Facilitating environmental policy decisions

## Data Sources
- **Satellite Imagery**: Landsat, Sentinel-2, and commercial satellite providers
- **Weather Data**: Global weather station networks and meteorological services
- **IoT Sensors**: Air quality sensors, soil moisture sensors, and weather stations
- **Government Data**: Environmental agency databases and public datasets

## Future Development
- Integration with drone imagery
- Real-time alert systems for environmental threats
- Mobile app for field data collection
- Advanced AI models for environmental prediction
