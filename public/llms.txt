Featured projects include ML-powered groundwater prediction using satellite data, time-series forecasting systems, geospatial optimization algorithms, and production web applications. Technical expertise spans Python, React, TypeScript, Flask, Google Earth Engine, Scikit-learn, and modern web technologies.

## About

I'm an AI Engineering student focused on applying machine learning to real-world problems, particularly in geospatial analysis and environmental monitoring. My work combines data science, ML engineering, and full-stack development to build systems that provide actionable insights for critical challenges like water resource management, infrastructure optimization, and educational decision-making.

## Featured Projects

- [WaterTrace Pakistan](https://tayyabmanan.com/projects/watertrace): ML-powered groundwater prediction system using 22 years of NASA satellite data (GRACE & GLDAS). Features time-series forecasting models achieving R²=0.89 accuracy, processing 235 monthly observations across 145 districts. Built with React, Flask, Scikit-learn, and Google Earth Engine. Addresses Pakistan's critical water crisis through predictive analytics.

- [TeacherRank](https://tayyabmanan.com/projects/teacher-rank): Full-stack student-driven teacher review platform with multi-dimensional rating system. Built with React 18, TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL + real-time subscriptions), TanStack Query, and Tailwind CSS. Features include JWT authentication, row-level security, real-time synchronization, advanced search with caching, and PWA capabilities. Lighthouse score 95+.

- [EV Suitability Analysis](https://tayyabmanan.com/projects/ev-analysis): Geospatial AI system for optimal EV charging station placement using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and weighted scoring algorithms. Integrates 2023 Pakistan Census data, OpenStreetMap infrastructure, and demographic indicators. Built with Python, GeoPandas, and QGIS. Identified 5 priority sites through ML-optimized ranking for 90%+ coverage.
