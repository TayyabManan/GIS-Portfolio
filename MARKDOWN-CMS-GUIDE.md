2. Rename to your project slug (e.g., `my-new-project.md`)
3. Update the frontmatter metadata
4. Write your project content
5. Add project images to `public/projects/`

### Example Workflow
```bash
# 1. Copy template
cp content/projects/_template.md content/projects/my-awesome-gis-tool.md

# 2. Edit the file with your content
# Update frontmatter and write your project details

# 3. Add project image
# Place your image in public/projects/my-awesome-gis-tool.jpg

# 4. Your project is ready!
```

## 🔄 Migration Path (Optional)

Your current system works perfectly. When you're ready to use markdown:

1. **Install dependency** (if using full version):
   ```bash
   npm install gray-matter
   ```

2. **Update your components** to use markdown functions:
   ```typescript
   import { getAllProjectsFromMarkdown } from '@/lib/markdown-simple'
   
   // Replace your current projects import
   const projects = getAllProjectsFromMarkdown()
   ```
