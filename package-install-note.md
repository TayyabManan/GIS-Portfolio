# Required Package Installation

To use the markdown CMS functionality, you need to install the `gray-matter` package:

```bash
npm install gray-matter
```

This package is used to parse the frontmatter (metadata) from markdown files.

## Alternative Implementation (No Dependencies)
If you prefer not to install additional packages, you can use the basic markdown reading utilities that parse frontmatter manually using built-in Node.js functionality.
