# Electric Vehicle Suitability Analysis

## Overview
A geospatial AI project leveraging machine learning algorithms for optimal Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure placement. This ML-powered spatial optimization system combines demographic data, economic indicators, infrastructure networks, and geospatial intelligence to identify priority sites for EV charging stations in Lahore through multi-criteria decision analysis and weighted scoring algorithms.

## Key Features
 - **AI-Powered Site Selection**: Multi-criteria optimization algorithm for EV charging stations across Lahore's 5 tehsils
 - **Weighted Scoring ML Model**: Data-driven scoring algorithm integrating demographic, accessibility, and growth factors
 - **Interactive Geospatial Visualizations**: Dynamic maps showing site suitability scores and optimization results
 - **Automated Spatial Analysis**: Python-based ML pipeline for reproducible site selection
 - **Optimization Results**: 5 priority sites identified through ML ranking, 3-phase deployment strategy, 90%+ coverage target
 - **Multi-Source Data Integration**: 2023 Pakistan Census, OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries
 - **Feature-Weighted Algorithm**: ML-optimized weights (population 30%, growth 20%, accessibility 25%, infrastructure 15%, economic 10%)

## Technical Architecture
Python-based geospatial ML pipeline utilizing GeoPandas and Shapely for spatial operations, NumPy for numerical optimization, and Folium for interactive map visualizations. OpenStreetMap Overpass API integration for real-time infrastructure data. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) algorithm with weighted linear combination for site scoring. HTML/JavaScript frontend for interactive exploration of ML-generated site rankings. CSV/JSON data interchange for reproducible analysis.
