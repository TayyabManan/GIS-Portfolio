# Electric Vehicle Suitability Analysis

## Overview
A comprehensive spatial analysis project focused on Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure, adoption patterns, and related socio-economic factors using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This project combines demographic, economic, infrastructure, and satellite data to provide insights into EV accessibility and adoption patterns in Lahore.

## Key Features
 - Overview: Multi-criteria site selection for EV charging stations in Lahore's 5 tehsils
 - Key Features: Site scoring algorithm, demographic integration, interactive maps, automated reporting
 - Technical Architecture: Python-based spatial analysis with OSM data integration
 - Project Impact: Specific results - 5 priority sites identified, 3-phase deployment strategy, 90%+ coverage
  target
 - Data Sources: 2023 Pakistan Census, OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries
 - Methodology: Weighted scoring system (population 30%, growth 20%, accessibility 25%, etc.)

## Technical Architecture
 Python for spatial analysis and data processing. Geospatial libraries (likely GeoPandas, Shapely, Folium for maps). OpenStreetMap Overpass API integration. HTML/JavaScript for interactive maps. CSV/JSON for data interchange

## Environmental Impact
The platform has been instrumental in:
- Air Quality Improvement
- Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction
- Noise Pollution Mitigation
- Urban Heat Island Reduction
- Sustainable Urban Development

## Data Sources
- **Open Street Map**: Freely available geospatial data.
- **Census Data**: Demographic data of census 2023.

## Future Development
- Expansion to other Pakistani cities
- Real-time traffic integration
- Economic feasibility modeling
- Energy grid capacity analysis
