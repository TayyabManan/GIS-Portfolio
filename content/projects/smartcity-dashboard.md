# SmartCity Dashboard

## Overview
The SmartCity Dashboard is an innovative real-time monitoring and management platform designed for modern urban infrastructure. This comprehensive solution provides city administrators with unified visibility into traffic flow, energy consumption, waste management, and emergency services, enhanced with predictive analytics capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Infrastructure Monitoring**: Live tracking of city-wide systems and services
- **Traffic Flow Management**: Dynamic traffic monitoring with congestion prediction
- **Energy Consumption Analytics**: Smart grid monitoring and usage optimization
- **Waste Management System**: Route optimization and collection scheduling
- **Emergency Services Coordination**: Incident tracking and resource allocation
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI-powered forecasting for proactive city management

## Technical Stack
The dashboard is built using Angular for a dynamic and responsive frontend, Express.js for robust backend services, and MongoDB for flexible data storage. Data visualization is powered by D3.js, while MapboxGL provides interactive mapping capabilities. Redis is used for high-performance caching and real-time data processing.

## Smart City Integration
The platform integrates with various city systems:
- **Traffic Management Systems**: Real-time traffic light control and monitoring
